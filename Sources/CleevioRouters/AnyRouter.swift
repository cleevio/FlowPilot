/**
 A type-erased router that can present and dismiss view controllers using the underlying platform-specific router.
 
 - Note: This class conforms to the `Router` protocol, which defines the basic functionality for presenting and dismissing view controllers. The `AnyRouter` class can be used to hide the specific type of router being used, while still providing the same interface for presenting and dismissing view controllers.
